## Projects

### 1. Square Predictor
A simple project that predicts the square of a given number.  

**Focus:** Regression basics and understanding model training.

---

### 2. Flight Price Prediction *(Ongoing)*
A machine learning model that predicts flight prices based on various features:  

- Airline  
- Source and destination cities  
- Departure and arrival times  
- Travel class (Economy, Business, etc.)  
- Number of stops  

The project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation to predict realistic flight prices.
